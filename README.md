# Android Services

This project targets to showcase different usage of Android Service Components. Tracking progress of a task within a service with the help of broadcast receivers.

The app follows MVP pattern. TBH this is first time working on MVP architecture. Do check my other projects for MVVM, which I like.

Few extra this app will include:
- Network call using Retrofit
- Usage of Coroutines for asynchronous tasks
- Broadcast Receiver to track progress of service
- Different kinds of Services
- Will try to add test cases too
