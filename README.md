# Android Services

This project targets to showcase different usage of Android Service Components.
Track progress of network call and show in notification

The app follows MVP pattern. TBH this is first time working on MVP architecture. Do check my other projects for MVVM, which I like.

Few extra this app will include:
- Network call using Retrofit
- Usage of Coroutines for asynchronous tasks
- Will try to add test cases too
